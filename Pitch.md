Parking System Application Pitch
Project Overview

The Parking System Application is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to manage and streamline the parking operations of a facility. Utilizing modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a JSON server for backend operations, this application offers a user-friendly interface for managing car entries and exits, tracking available spaces, and ensuring efficient use of parking resources.
Key Features

    Real-Time Car Management:
        Add New Car: Allows users to register new cars with details such as license plate, model, owner, and time of parking.
        Edit Car Details: Users can update car information effortlessly.
        Delete Car: Enables removal of car records from the system when they leave the parking lot.

    Data Persistence:
        Leveraging a JSON server to store and manage car data, ensuring changes are saved and retrievable across sessions.

    User Interface:
        Dynamic Car List: Displays a real-time list of parked cars with relevant details.
        Intuitive Form: A simple form to add new cars to the system.
        Interactive Buttons: Edit and delete buttons for each car entry for easy management.

    Real-Time Updates:
        The application fetches and updates car data in real-time, ensuring the displayed information is always current.

Technical Stack

    Frontend:
        HTML: Structure of the web pages.
        CSS: Styling to ensure a clean, user-friendly interface.
        JavaScript: Client-side logic for dynamic updates and interaction handling.

    Backend:
        JSON Server: A lightweight server for managing data storage and retrieval operations via RESTful APIs.

Implementation Details

    HTML:
        Structured to include sections for displaying the parking lot, adding new cars, and buttons for interaction.

    CSS:
        Designed to provide a clean, modern look, ensuring the interface is easy to navigate.

    JavaScript:
        Data Fetching: Utilizes fetch API to get data from the JSON server.
        Event Handling: Listens for form submissions and button clicks to perform CRUD operations.
        Real-Time Updates: Ensures the display updates immediately after any data change.

    JSON Server:
        Acts as the backend, storing car data and responding to GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests.

How It Works

    Loading the Page:
        When the page loads, the application fetches the list of currently parked cars from the JSON server and displays them.

    Adding a Car:
        Users fill out the form with car details and submit it. This sends a POST request to the JSON server to add the new car, and the list updates in real-time.

    Editing a Car:
        Clicking the edit button next to a car entry prompts the user to update the car details. This sends a PATCH request to the server, updating the car's information.

    Deleting a Car:
        The delete button removes the car from the list and sends a DELETE request to the server to remove the car data.

Benefits

    Efficiency: Streamlines the process of managing parking, reducing manual effort.
    Real-Time Data: Ensures up-to-date information, aiding in effective parking management.
    User-Friendly: Simple interface makes it easy for users to interact with the system.

Future Enhancements

    Search and Filter: Adding search and filter capabilities to quickly find specific cars.
    Parking Spot Allocation: Assigning specific spots to cars and managing availability.
    User Authentication: Securing the application to restrict access to authorized personnel.

By implementing this Parking System Application, facilities can significantly improve their parking management efficiency, ensuring a smooth and organized parking experience for all users.
